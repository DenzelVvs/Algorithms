1.  ## Algorithm Analysis

  + For this practical, we analyse the difference between a **Brute Force Algorithm** and a **Binary Search Algorithm**. ThreeSumA implements the brute force algorithm while ThreeSumB implements the binary search algorithm. Both are timed and tested in their respective main methods using the Stopwatch class and the data (inside data folder) that was provided. The analysis shows that the binary search algorithm is significantly much better in performance compared to using a brute force approach.

2.  ## Complexity

  + For this practical, we implement the **Russian Peasant Algorithm** and look at its complexity. Within the class, you will find a commented out function, it works the same as the other function, the only difference is that the commented out function returns a BigInteger while the other returns a long integer. Within the main method, I have set up a couple of tests using a  mixture of small and large numbers.

3.  ## Recursion

  + For this practical, we implement **a function that returns a specific value within the Fibonacci sequence**. We do this by implementing it **iteratively** and **recursively**. These could be tested inside the main method where we pass in different values into both functions. Additionally, we also implement **a recursive function that solves the Tower of Hanoi problem** in a separate class. This could be tested by changing the disk size of the tower (variable called 'diskSize').

4.  ## Elementary Sorting

  + For this practical, we implement elementary sorting algorithms, which are **Insertion Sort** and **Selection Sort**. We were also tasked with implementing an inefficient sort or a 'silly sort' and the one I chose is **BogoSort** which just randomly shuffles the array until it is sorted. When I tested BogoSort, I only tested it for a small dataset as I could potentially go on for a long time if tested with a bigger dataset.

5.  ##  Advanced Sorting Algorithm - MergeSort

  + For this practical, we implement **MergeSort** and an **Enhanced MergeSort** which takes in a cut off value so that when it reaches this cut off value, Insertion Sort is used instead. These functions are tested against each other using data that could be found within the sorting_data folder inside the src folder.

6.  ##  Advanced Sorting Algorithm - QuickSort

  + For this practical, we implement **QuickSort** and an **Enhanced QuickSort** which takes in a cut off value so that when it reaches this cut off value, Insertion Sort is used instead. These functions are tested against each other using data that could be found within the sorting_data folder inside the src folder.

7.  ##  Substring Search

  + For this practical, we implement the **KMP Search Algorithm** and compare its performance to a brute force approach. 

8.  ##  Tries

  + For this practical, we implement **a function to create a Trie from a set of words**. The tests for this could be found within the main method which are just commented out.

9.  ##  Data Compression

  + For this practical, we implement **Run Length Encoding for a String** (called as StringRLE) which tries to compress a given string. This could be tested within the main maethod. Furthermore, we were also tasked with looking at binary compression by testing the files provided using the command line. These files could be found within the src folder as I had problems with running them within the lab9 package. My analysis of these files could be found within data_compression.docx which could found within the src folder.
